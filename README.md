# BatCastModel

Final project for Ai in Biology -- Spring 2021 -- by MW Belitz and CJ Campbell. 

We simulated data of bat emergences that we thought would be biologically relevant using weather data. This simulated dataset can be found in the **/data folder**. Scripts to 
build this simulated dataset are found in the /Rscripts folder.

To build our model to predict how many bats will emerge from a bat house on a given night, we trained a neural net. Our process to train and test this model can be found in the 
Jupyter Notebook titled **"BatCast_FinalProject.ipynb"**.
